        <p class="para">My hobby is playing Minecraft, devoloping things to insert into code for Minecraft, and playing in Minecraft championships. Whenever I get the chance I like making "skins" for Minecraft which means how I look inside the game. I am 10 years old and I am able to make very complicated changes to Minecraft. Now that I go to school I get less time for this but I am still able to keep my hobby alive by watching people code things into Minecraft on Youtube! This hobby is unique and difficult and I usually don't see people doing things like this but it is quite enjoyable and is always making me learn new things in computer technology.There is one person I take lots of inspiration from, he is a Youtuber going by the name of Dream but he always makes lots of Minecraft code which is fun and entertaining to watch.This hobby of mine is really important to me and I plan to continue doing it for quite some time as a fun way to pass time.
